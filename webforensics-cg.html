    </ul>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>The scope of this group&#39;s work will encompass the following areas related to web forensics and online evidence acquisition:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Digital Forensics Process Model (DFPM) adaptation for web evidence</strong>: Researching and detailing the application of the DFPM stages (Preparation, Gathering/Acquisition, Processing/Examination, Presentation/Reporting) specifically to web-based investigations.  </li>
      <li><strong>Web Evidence Characteristics</strong>: Defining web evidence and its unique properties, such as its dynamic and volatile nature, and the challenges this poses for acquisition and integrity.  </li>
      <li><strong>Specific Web Acquisition Sources</strong>: Investigating methodologies and best practices for acquiring evidence from diverse online sources, including:  <ul>
      <li><strong>Websites</strong>: Capturing and preserving content, metadata, HTML source code, network traffic, screenshots, pageshots, and video recordings. This includes static, dynamic, and ephemeral content.  </li>
      <li><strong>Email, Web Messaging, Social Networks</strong>: Techniques for collecting user activity, metadata, multimedia content, and message logs, while navigating challenges like encryption, privacy settings, and APIs.  </li>
      <li><strong>P2P-Torrent, Cloud Storage, Tor/DarkWeb, Metaverse</strong>: Specialized approaches for decentralized networks, remote storage, anonymized environments, and virtual worlds, addressing their unique properties and particularities.  </li>
      <li><strong>Browser Forensics</strong>: Examining web browser profiles and their components (bookmarks, history, cookies, extensions, preferences, autofill, local storage) as sources of user activity and evidence. This also includes analysis of <code>blob_storage</code>, cache, DevTools, and configuration URLs for forensic insights.  </li>
      <li><strong>Acquisition Tools and Techniques</strong>: Evaluating and recommending various tools and techniques for web evidence acquisition, such as browser extensions, utilities (APIs, curl, wget), purpose-built web forensic software, network traffic capture tools (Wireshark, tcpdump), and video recording tools.  </li>
      <li><strong>Evidence Integrity and Verification</strong>: Researching and promoting the use of cryptographic hashing (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-1, SHA-3) to ensure data integrity and authenticity, as well as the importance of timestamps and Chain of Custody documentation.  </li>
      <li><strong>Acquisition Environment Setup</strong>: Best practices for configuring a robust and controlled acquisition environment using virtualization technologies (Virtual Machines, Containers, SaaS), considering operating system choices (Windows, Linux, MacOSX).  </li>
      <li><strong>Addressing Acquisition Challenges</strong>: Developing strategies and proposing solutions for overcoming complex web content acquisition issues, including dynamic content, anti-scraping measures, and interactive elements requiring operator intervention.  </li>
      <li><strong>Integration of Acquisition Methods</strong>: Investigating the benefits of integrating different acquisition methods, such as combining video recording and network traffic capture, for a more comprehensive view of web activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h3>
    <p>While related to digital forensics, the following areas are generally considered out of scope for this Community Group, unless directly relevant to the acquisition and analysis of <em>online</em> web-based evidence:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-web specific Digital Forensics</strong>: Detailed methodologies for other types of digital forensics, such as standalone computer forensics (hard drives, file systems, operating systems), malware forensics (analysis of malicious software not hosted on the web), mobile device forensics, memory forensics, cloud storage forensics (beyond web-based services), network forensics (beyond web traffic), and blockchain forensics, unless they directly provide artifacts or context for web-related investigations.  </li>
      <li><strong>Physical Forensics</strong>: Investigations involving physical objects or scenes that do not have a digital web component.  </li>
      <li><strong>General IT Security Operations</strong>: Activities like general network security, system administration, and penetration testing that are not performed for forensic evidence collection or investigation purposes.  </li>
      <li><strong>Legal Processes (beyond evidence admissibility)</strong>: While legal admissibility and compliance are crucial for forensic reports, the group will not delve into the specifics of legal proceedings or court rules beyond what is necessary for evidence handling and reporting.  </li>
      <li><strong>Development of new forensic tools</strong>: While the group may recommend types of tools or features, the direct development of new web forensic software or hardware is not a primary objective.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. If the group
      uses GitHub, all technical work will occur in its GitHub repositories
      (and not in mailing list discussions). This is to ensure contributions
      can be tracked through a software tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list, or
      to a GitHub issue if the group uses GitHub.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p class="remove">
      If the decision policy is documented somewhere, update this section accordingly to link to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions where there is consensus. Groups
      are free to decide how to make decisions (e.g. Participants who have
      earned Committer status for a history of useful contributions assess
      consensus, or the Chair assesses consensus, or where consensus isn't
      clear there is a Call for Consensus [CfC] to allow multi-day online
      feedback for a proposed course of action). It is expected that
      participants can earn Committer status through a history of valuable
      contributions as is common in open source projects. After discussion and
      due consideration of different opinions, a decision should be publicly
      recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      If substantial disagreement remains (e.g. the group is divided) and the
      group needs to decide an Issue in order to continue to make progress, the
      Committers will choose an alternative that had substantial support (with
      a vote of Committers if necessary). Individuals who disagree with the
      choice are strongly encouraged to take ownership of their objection by
      taking ownership of an alternative fork. This is explicitly allowed (and
      preferred to blocking progress) with a goal of letting implementation
      experience inform which spec is ultimately chosen by the group to move
      ahead with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub Issue for groups that use GitHub and otherwise on the group's
      public mail list. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to this decision process.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
